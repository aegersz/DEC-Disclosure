## Abstract

The Digital Energy Cell (DEC) is a proprietary energy storage device that combines dielectric capacitive behavior with modular battery architecture. It utilizes a novel pairing of crystalline Silicon Dioxide (SiO2) with dielectric oils (mineral oil, vegetable oil, fish oil, etc.) to form a solid-state or semi-liquid capacitor-battery hybrid.

The device is intended as a direct replacement for lithium-ion batteries, offering significant advantages in:

- Safety (non-flammable, no thermal runaway)
- Sustainability (no lithium, cobalt, or rare earths)
- Longevity (capacitor-like cycle life)
- Custom scalability (modular units from small home batteries to grid-scale)

## Core Components

1. Dielectric System
   - Primary: Silicon Dioxide (SiO2)
   - Secondary: Proprietary dielectric oil blends

2. Separator
   - Optional: Bentonite clay layer or polymer film

3. Electrodes
   - Materials: Palladium, Silver, Graphite, or Aluminum
   - Optional inclusion of Thorium-rich oils or layered crystal lattices in advanced models

4. Inversion Capability
   - The DEC architecture optionally supports modular or integrated DC-AC inversion
   - This replaces the need for a separate inverter in home solar systems

## Key Innovations

- Capacitive-like rapid charge/discharge behavior
- Patent-pending dielectric formulation
- High resilience to heat, pressure, and degradation
- Compatibility with solar energy systems
- Modular form factor
- Fireproof and recyclable
